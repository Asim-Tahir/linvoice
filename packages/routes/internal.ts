 * âš  These are internal routes!
 * They will be rendered inside the app, using the default `containers/Layout`.
 * If you want to add a route to, let's say, a landing page, you should add
 * it to the `App`'s router, exactly like `Login`, `CreateAccount` and other pages
 * are routed.
 *
 * If you're looking for the links rendered in the SidebarContent, go to
 * `routes/sidebar.js`
 *
 * NOTE: use lazy for better code splitting, a.k.a. load faster
